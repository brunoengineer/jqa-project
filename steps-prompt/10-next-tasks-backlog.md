# Step 10 — Backlog (after v1)

## Goal
Capture next tasks without implementing them yet.

## Potential next tasks
- Add more agents/tasks:
  - Create Test Case
  - Create Test Plan
  - Summarize PR
  - Release Notes
- Per-project default provider + model
- Better API-key handling (do not persist by default; optional secure storage later)
- Export documents (zip)
- Optional: Electron packaging

## Copilot prompt

Given the current QA Lobby v1, propose a small v1.1 backlog with 5-8 items.

Constraints:
- Each item must be small (1-3 hours)
- Must not require cloud services
- Prioritize QA productivity

Return as a checklist.
